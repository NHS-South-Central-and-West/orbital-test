# Orbital Demo

**Note:** In order to get this to work, you will need to drop the `params.py` file into the `utils` folder once you have installed the project. It contains the the confidential elements of the warehouse connection and has therefore been .gitignored so that it does not end up in the public repository.

A copy of the file can be found on the shared drive under `Specialist Analytics > orbital_demo_params`
